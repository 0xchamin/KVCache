*An educational web application that brings Key-Value Cache concepts to life*

## Overview

This interactive visualization tool was inspired by Sebastian Raschka's excellent article ["Understanding and Coding the KV Cache in LLMs from Scratch"](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2025/coding-the-kv-cache-in-llms.html). While Raschka provides the theoretical foundation and PyTorch implementation, this tool offers a visual, hands-on approach to understanding KV-Cache concepts.

## The Problem KV-Cache Solves

Without KV-Cache, transformer models face **O(nÂ²) computational explosion** during text generation:
- Token 1: 1 computation
- Token 2: 2 computations  
- Token 3: 3 computations
- Token n: n computations
- **Total**: ~nÂ²/2 operations

This makes real-time AI conversation impossible. KV-Cache transforms this to **O(n) linear complexity**.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Visualizations
- **Token Processing Pipeline**: Step-by-step token flow with interactive controls
- **Computation Complexity Comparison**: Side-by-side O(nÂ²) vs O(n) matrix visualization
- **Multi-Head Attention**: 4 specialized attention heads (Syntax, Semantic, Position, Long-range)
- **Real-time Cache Building**: Watch key-value pairs accumulate in each head

### ðŸ”§ Interactive Controls
- **Step-by-step Processing**: Process tokens one at a time or automatically
- **Multiple Orchestration Modes**: 
  - Basic KV-Cache (standard behavior)
  - Shared Cache (with cache hit/miss simulation)
- **Dynamic Explanations**: Real-time descriptions of cache behavior

### ðŸ“Š Educational Insights
- **Triangle vs Linear Pattern**: Visual representation of computational complexity
- **Cache Hit/Miss Simulation**: Understanding shared cache efficiency
- **Attention Weight Visualization**: See how different heads focus on different patterns
